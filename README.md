## 📝 GSAP Plugins Note

This project uses GSAP animation libraries. For the full experience with ScrollSmoother and SplitText plugins, you'll need a GSAP Club membership. I've used trial plugins for development, but for production hosting, you'll need to:

1. Get GSAP Club plugins: https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Installation/
2. Replace the trial plugins with the official ones
